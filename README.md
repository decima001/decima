# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rasaq Ifedapo - Cybersecurity Defender Expanding My Arsenal with Backend Skills

As a cybersecurity professional with a background in threat intelligence, incident response, penetration testing, I'm embarking on an exciting journey into the realm of backend programming. My goal is to bridge the gap between security principles and software development practices, ultimately becoming a more well-rounded and effective defender (and perhaps even builder!).

## Why Backend?

My motivation for learning backend development stems from a desire to:

* **Gain a Deeper Understanding of Systems:** By understanding how applications are built from the ground up, I can better identify potential vulnerabilities and design more robust security measures.
* **Automate Security Tasks:** Backend skills will empower me to develop custom tools and scripts for automation, streamlining tasks like log analysis, vulnerability scanning, and incident response.
* **Contribute to Secure Development Practices:** I aim to bring a security-first mindset to the development lifecycle, advocating for and implementing secure coding practices.
* **Expand My Skillset:** In the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape, continuous learning is paramount. Backend programming is a crucial skill that will enhance my ability to analyze, understand, and secure modern applications.

## Current Learning Focus

Currently, I'm focusing on  e.g., Python/Django, Node.js/Express, Go]. My learning journey involves:

* **Core Programming Concepts:** Solidifying my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software design principles within the chosen language(s).
* **Backend Frameworks:** Learning to leverage frameworks to build scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
* **Database Interactions:** Mastering database technologies (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) and secure data handling.
* **API Development:** Understanding RESTful and other API architectures and how to secure them.
* **Security in Backend Development:** Specifically focusing on common backend vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting), secure authentication and authorization, and secure API design.

## Projects & Contributions

As I progress, I'll be sharing projects and contributions that demonstrate my growing backend skills and my unique perspective as a cybersecurity professional. Expect to see projects that might involve:

* Security automation tools
* Vulnerability analysis scripts
* Secure API implementations
* Potentially, contributions to open-source security-focused projects.

## Let's Connect!

I'm eager to connect with other developers and security professionals on this learning journey. Feel free to reach out if you have any insights, advice, or potential collaboration opportunities!
